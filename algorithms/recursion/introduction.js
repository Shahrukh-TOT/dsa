/**
 * - This is not an algorithm but a technique to write algorithm.
 * - A fuctions refers to it self in the function called recursion.
 * - It's helpful to solve repeated sub tasks in a task.
 * 
 * Problems with recursion
 * 1. Stack Overflow issue
 * 
 * Every Recursion function must have a base case
 * 
 * Recursion has 2 pass
 * 1. base case
 * 2. recursion case
 * 
 * How to implement recursion
 * 1. Identify the base case
 * 2. Identify the recursive case
 * 3. Get closer and closer and return when needed. Usually you have 2 returns
 * 
 * Anything you do with a recursion CAN be done iteratively (loop)
 * 
 * Pros
 * DRY
 * Readability
 * 
 * Cons
 * Large stack
 * 
 * Tail Call Optimization
